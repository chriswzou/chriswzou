## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Great to meet you. ðŸ˜Š

- **Software engineering** at [Datavant](http://datavant.com/), a healthcare interoperability startup.
- **Founding UC Berkeley's healthcare startup accelerator** with friends at [Phoenix Consulting Group](https://phoenix.berkeley.edu).

### ðŸŒ±  What else I'm doing ...
- Reading _Madam Speaker: Nancy Pelosi and the Lessons of Power_.
- Learning guitar (very slowly).

### ðŸ’¬  Let's connect!
I'm currently located in NYC! Feel free to reach me at cwzou@berkeley.edu. Otherwise, here are my socials:
