## Hey, great to meet you!

I'm Chris, a recent Cal grad living in SF. Broadly, I want to help others live longer, happier lives. More specifically, I'm interested in building better tools to accelerate biological discovery.

I'm currently working on functional genomics projects at UCSF while a software engineer at Datavant.
