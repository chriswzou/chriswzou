## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Great to meet you!

I'm Chris, a senior at UC Berkeley wrapping up degrees in Computer Science and Biochemistry. Broadly, I want to help others live longer, happier lives. More specifically, I'm interested in startups and tech as applied to healthcare and biology.

### âš¡  Currently working on ...
- **Building [Health Engine](https://readysethealth.io), UC Berkeley's healthcare startup accelerator,** with friends at [Phoenix Consulting Group](https://phoenix.berkeley.edu).
- I'll be an intern at Nuna this coming summer.

### ðŸŒ±  What else I'm doing ...
- Taking a break from reading, which is weird.
- Learning guitar (very slowly).

### ðŸ’¬  Let's connect!
