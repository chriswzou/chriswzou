## Hey, great to meet you!

I'm Chris, a software engineer at Datavant. Broadly, I want to help others live longer, happier lives. More specifically, I'm interested in startups and tech as applied to healthcare and biology.

I'm currently working on functional genomics projects at UCSF while a software engineer at Datavant.
